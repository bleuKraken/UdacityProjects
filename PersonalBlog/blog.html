          Chris Milk is a director, photographer, and known by many as an innovator and immersive artist. Accompanied by Joshua Roman on cello and McKenzie Stubbert on piano, in this Ted Talk given on February 2016 Milk discusses how virtual reality
          is the next medium to share stories with others.
          He begins his story from the first moment he remembers putting on a pair of headphones, to his current work with creating breakthrough virtual reality projects available on different platforms. <q><i>VR is the last medium for
              storytelling</i></q>, he says, because it closes the gap
          between audience and storyteller. It bridges the viewers conscious with the content.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Power of Music
        </h3>
        <p>
          Chris Milk shares that when he was a kid, he experienced something so powerful, he spent the rest of his life searching for it. What he experienced wasn't virtual reality; it was music. Music goes straight to the emotional vein, into your
          bloodstream, and right into your heart. It deepens every experience. Music gives everything a more emotional resonance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <q><i>The right piece of music at the right time fuses with us on a cellular level.</i></q> - Milk
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk began directing music videos in an effort to recreate the feelings that he experienced from when he first heard music. Creating music videos with moving animations layered on top of music, and a narrative created a different feel.
          However, Milk claims it just was not the same
          emotional connection that he had felt with just music. So Milk went on a search to try and capture the emotional experience that music can create, and tried to find a way to share that experience with others.
          <h3>
            Virtual Reality as A New Medium
          </h3>
          <p>
            Along with Aaron Koblin, Milk started auditioning new technologies that could bring people inside the work. They were trying to push beyond the screen, experimenting with different mediums of story telling. Milk decided to try something
            that he had only read about back in 2010 and this was VR.
          </p>
          <p>
            Telling a story in VR is not the same as reading a book or watching a movie. With a book you read the content and imagine the story in your head. Every person has his or her own interpretation over the fine details of the story like what
            the characters will ultimately look like,
            wear, and their personalities. Watching a movie allows us to watch a story and visually interpret what's going on through a screen that will never be more than a screen with no interaction from the viewers.
          </p>
          <p>
            With virtual reality, the movie or application is usually played out from a 180-degree or 360-degree view. This
            allows the viewer to rotate their head in any direction they choose. VR will place the viewer inside <strong>with</strong> the content. Life like structures, heights, and depths can be felt on a real level. The characters that are
            introduced
            can be standing right in front of you or within your personal space allowing a bond to form between the viewer and the characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the technologies of spatialized audio, we can now replicate the sounds that an object or source make coming from a distance, and direction. The participant can be locked into the experience because even if they turn their head
            to left or right, or even behind them, the sound will rotate
            accordingly and come from a specific direction just like listening to someone talk 10 feet in front of you. Spatialized audio can also be used to direct your attention to where you should be looking at as a movie moves from one scene into
            the next,
          </p>
          <h3>
            Bridging the Gap
          </h3>
          <p>
            Like Milk's talk about listening to someone tell the story of a hunter hunting a mammoth, with a headset on you <i>are</i> a hunter chasing after the mammoth. Or you can be the clan leader watching the hunt from a distance. Or maybe even
            you are the mammoth being hunted. New perspectives and emotional
            stories can be shared with the world using virtual reality.
