          Chris Milk is a director, photographer, and known by many as a innovator and immersive artist.
          Accompanied by Joshua Roman on cello and McKenzie Stubbert on piano, in this Ted Talk given on February 2016 Milk discusses how virtual reality is the next medium to share stories with others.
          He begins his story from the first moment he
          remembers putting on headphones to his current work with creating breakthrough virtual reality projects. <q><i>VR is the last medium for storytelling</i></q>, he says, because it closes the gap between audience and storyteller.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Power of Music
        </h3>
        <p>
          Chris Milk shares that when he was a kid, he experienced something so powerful, he spent the rest of his life searching for it. What he experienced wasn't virtual reality; it was music. Music goes straight to the emotional vein, into
          your
          bloodstream, and right into your heart. It deepens every experience. Music gives everything a more emotional resonance. The right piece of music at the right time fuses with us on a cellular level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Milk began directing music videos to try and recreate the feelings that he experienced from music. Adding moving pictures over the music added narrative dimension, but it never quite equated the power of raw music on its own. He began
          to
          wonder what would happen if he was able to involve the audience.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Virtual Reality as A New Medium
        </h3>
        <p>
          Along with Aaron Koblin, Milk started auditioning new technologies that could bring people inside the work. They were pushing beyond the screen, trying to connect more deeply to people's hearts and imaginations.
        </p>
        <p>
          With VR there is a complete surrounding environment where a participant may be able to turn around, look up and down, and maybe even walk around.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the technologies of spatialized audio, the replication of sounds that an object or source make from a distance in an enviornment, the participant can be locked into the experience
          because even if you turn your head to left or right, even behind you, the sound will rotate accordingly. It can also be used to direct your attention to where you should be looking as a story or experience unfolds.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Bridging the Gap
        </h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;Virtual reality bridges that gap. Now, you are on the tundra hunting with the clan leader. Or you are the clan leader. Or maybe even you're the woolly mammoth. In all other mediums, your consciousness interprets the medium. In VR,
          your
          consciousness is the medium.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;With VR, there is a unique, direct path into your senses, your emotions, even your body. Not surprisingly, music matters a lot in this medium. It guides us on how to feel. In one project, Milkâ€™s film takes you up in a helicopter, and
          even
          though you're flying 2,000 feet above Manhattan, you don't feel afraid. You feel triumphant for the character you are with. It is the music that guides you there.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;Contrary to popular belief, there is composition in virtual reality, but it's completely different than in film, where you have a rectangular frame. Composition is now where your consciousness exists and how the world moves around
          you. A
          close-up in VR means you're actually close up to someone. It brings that character inside of your personal space, a space that we'd usually reserve for the people that we love. You feel an emotional closeness to the character because of
          what you feel to be a physical closeness.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;Directing VR is not like directing for the rectangle. It's more of a choreography of the viewer's attention. One tool that is used to guide your attention is called "spatialized sound." By putting sound anywhere in front of you, to
          left or
          right, even behind you, when you turn your head, the sound will rotate accordingly. This can be used to direct your attention to where you should be looking.
